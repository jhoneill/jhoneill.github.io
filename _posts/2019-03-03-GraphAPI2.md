In [the previous post](/powershell/2019/02/28/Graph-Signin-Oauth.html) I looked at logging on to use Graph – [my msftgraph
module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MsftGraph) has a
`Connect-MsGraph` function which contains all of that and saves refresh tokens so
it can get an access token without repeating the logon process. It also
refreshes the token when its time is up. Once I have the token, I can start
calling the rest API. Everything in graph has a URL which looks like  
`https://graph.microsoft.com/version/type/id/subdivision`

Version is either “V1.0” or “beta” ; the resource type might be “user” or
“group”, or “notebook” and so on and a useful one is “me”; but you might call
user/ID to get a different user. To get the data you make an HTTP `GET` request
which returns JSON; to add something it is usually a `POST` request with the body
containing JSON which describes what you want to add, updates happen with a
`PATCH` request (more JSON), and `DELETE` requests do what you’d expect. Not
everything supports all four – there are a few things which allow creation, but
modification or deletion are on someone’s to do list.

The Connect-MsGraph function runs the following so the other functions can use
the token in whichever way is easiest:
{% highlight PowerShell %}
    if ($Response.access_token) {
        $Script:AccessToken   = $Response.access_token
        $Script:AuthHeader    = 'Bearer ' + $Response.access_token
        $Script:DefaultHeader = @{Authorization = $Script:AuthHeader}
    }
    
{% endhighlight %}
– by using the *script:* scope they are available throughout the module, and I
can I run
{% highlight powershell %}
    $result = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me" -Headers $DefaultHeader
    
{% endhighlight %}
Afterwards, `$result.Content` will contain this block of JSON   
`{ "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata\#users/$entity", "businessPhones":[], "displayName": "James O'Neill", "givenName": "James", "jobTitle": null,"mail": "xxxxx@xxxxxx.com", "mobilePhone": "+447890101010", "officeLocation":null, "preferredLanguage": "en-GB", "surname": "O'Neill", "userPrincipalName":"xxxxx@xxxxxx.com", "id": "12345678-abcd-6789-ab12-345678912345" }`

It doesn’t space it out to make it easy to read! There’s a **better way**: `Invoke-RestMethod` creates a PowerShell object, like this:

`Invoke-Restmethod -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me" -Headers $DefaultHeader`
```
@odata.context : https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata\#users/$entity
businessPhones : {}
displayName : James O'Neill
givenName : James
jobTitle :
mail : xxxxx@xxxxxx.com
mobilePhone : +447890101010
officeLocation :
preferredLanguage : en-GB
surname : O'Neill
userPrincipalName : xxxxx@xxxxxx.com
id : 12345678-abcd-6789-ab12-345678912345
```

Invoke-RestMethod automates the conversion of JSON into a PowerShell object; so this:
{% highlight powershell %}
    $D = Invoke-Restmethod -Uri "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive" -Headers $DefaultHeader
    
{% endhighlight %}

will let me refer to `$D.webUrl` to get the path to send a browser to in order to
see my OneDrive. It is quite easy to work out what to do with the objects which come
back from Invoke-RestMethod; **arrays** tend to come back in a `.value` property, some
data is **paged** and gives a property named `@odata.nextLink`, other objects –
like “me” give everything on the object. Writing the module, I added some
**formatting XML** so PowerShell would display things nicely. The work is
discovering URIs that are available to send a `GET` to, and what extra parameters can
be used – this isn’t 100% consistent – especially around adding query parameters
to the end of a URL (some don’t allow filtering, some do but it might be case
sensitive or insensitive, it might not combine with other query parameters and
so on) and although the Microsoft documentation is pretty good, in some places
it does feel like a work in progress. I ended up drawing a map and labelling it
with the functions I was building in the module – user related stuff is on the
left, teams and groups on the right and things which apply to both are in the
middle. The Visio which this is based on, and a PDF version of it are in the Repo
at <https://github.com/jhoneill/MsftGraph>

Once you can make your first call to the API the same techniques come up again
and again , and future posts will talk how to get [PowerShell formatting](/powershell/2019/03/06/TextWrangling3.html) working nicely, and [how to create JSON for POST](/powershell/2019/03/20/TextWrangling4.html) requests without massive amounts of
“text wrangling” But, as you can see from the map, there are many rabbit holes
to go down, I started with a desire to post a message to a channel in Teams.
Then I saw there was support for OneDrive and OneNote and work I had done on
them in the past called out for a re-visit. Once I started working with OneDrive
I wanted tab completion to expand files and folders, so I had to write an
argument completer… and every time I looked at the documentation I saw “There is
this bit you haven’t done” so I added more (I don’t have anywhere to experiment
with Intune so that is conspicuous by its absence, but I notice other people
have worked on that), and that’s how we end up with big software projects … and
patterns I used will come up in those future posts.
