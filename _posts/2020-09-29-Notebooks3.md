In [part one](/misc/2020/09/21/Notebooks.html) I covered installing [a version of Python with the Jupyter server](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and
adding extra Kernels – in particular .NET Interactive for PowerShell support.
After a quick exchange with some friends on twitter it seems I could have
explained something better in [part two](/misc/2020/09/23/Notebooks2.html) about the different ways .NET Interactive
works with Azure Data Studio and Visual Studio Code, which is what I’m going to
try to cover first.

The Jupyter server can work in two different ways. My set-up of default_anaconda_installation + .net Interactive from part 1 gives the ability to run a 
Jupyter server and access it through a web browser to work with notebooks stored as .ipynb files.

If Azure Data Studio (or the Python extension in VS Code) is told to open a
.ipynb file it starts Python to run exactly the same web server, specifying the
port and access token it should use and then it makes API-calls to use the server *without* a web
front end. You can see this in Azure Data Studio below, and the link at the
bottom will open in a browser allowing two instances of a kernel on one web server to see the same
set of files. Because each client is using its own Kernel there is no interaction
between code in one and code in the other.

![The Jupyter server run from Azure data Studio](/assets/9ae8b7ca2c5fb73ff1dc118f00091dbb.png)

Getting the Process object for the current PowerShell process with     
`Get-process -id $pid` and then checking its parent process, than that process’s parent and so on shows that    
`[Azuredatastudio]` -runs- `[cmd]` -to launch- `[python]` -which runs Jupyter and starts a
kernel- `[dotnet]` -which hosts- `[dotnet-interactive]` which has PowerShell built in. 

So Azure Data Studio does its own rendering but uses the *Python* Jupyter bits for everything else. The Jupyter Kernel for Windows PowerShell comes with Azure Data Studio,
but Data Studio can use any Kernel known to Jupyter, so if you install .NET Interactive Kernels they will be usuable in Data Studio - they're just a different installation.

I said in part 2 that the .NET interactive extension for VS code uses its own
installation – when Python launches the kernel it runs      
`<home>\.dotnet\tools\dotnet-interactive.exe Jupyter <parameters>`.    
Things are different in VS code.  
`[Code]` -runs- `[dotnet tool run <parameters>]` -which runs- `[dotnet <home>\.nuget\…\
Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.App.dll <parameters>]`    
No Python, no Jupyter web server, it goes directly to the Kernel, loading files
from the `.nuget` directory instead of from the `.net` one.

I also referred to the difference between Jupyter-generated output and output
from the DotNet-Interactive Extension for VS code (I’m tempted to start
abbreviating that to DNIE pronounced like "deny"). Jupyter creates JSON inside the
ipnyb file like this:

{% highlight json %}
"outputs": [
    {
        "output_type": "stream",
        "name": "stdout",
        "text": [  
            "Line 1",  
            "Line 2",  
            "Line 3"  
        ]
    }
]
{% endhighlight %}
It’s also valid to have `"text": "A long string with \n for newlines"`

*At the moment* the extension for vs code writes like this:
{% highlight json %}
"outputs": [
    {
        "output_type": "execute_result",
        "data": { "text/plain": "Line 1" }
    },
    { 
        "output_type": "execute_result",
        "data": { "text/plain": "Line 2" }
    }
]
{% endhighlight %}
Both forms seem to be read everywhere but often the Jupyter format reads more nicely. I would
stress *at the moment,* because, to repeat what I said in part 2, **this is a
preview and things can change**.

Being JSON internally, **lots of things can read and/or write ipynb format**. A
notebook file has a `metadata` block which says what language it uses, and a
`cells` block, each cell has a `type` (code or markdown), `source`, and – for code-cells - `output`. 
My friend Doug Finke has a [PowerShell module to help work with notebooks and their content](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PowerShellNotebook) and I'll talk more after looking at some of the other useful tools:

-   **GitHub** will display the contents of a .ipynb. file in read-only form
    -skipping any JavaScript.

-   [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) seems to use the same templates as git hub
    but *doesn’t* filter out the Javascript. If I run something on my computer,
    *my results* are embedded in the Notebook, and someone I share them with might
    not have access to *my data*, so being able to show a chart is a consideration.   
    ![nbViewer showing a plotly chart](/assets/196d36a961e5db8aa9edef6eed602e9c.png)    
    Incidentally, the screenshot above shows a notebook from [my git hub repo](https://github.com/jhoneill/Notebooks) - someone asked a question in a photography
forum which led me to do a heat map of how often I use lenses / setting combinations, drawn from the
[Adobe LightRoom data](https://jhoneill.github.io/powershell/photography/2012/08/09/Lightroom-data.html)
I’ve been messing with for years.

-   [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) goes even further. It gives you a **docker container** running the
    Jupiter server, and will copy information from a **GitHub repo** into the container for the server to use. 
    By default, it doesn’t have the additional Kernels from .NET
    interactive, but you can provide a `dockerfile` to configure the container – I
    got mine , and the associated `nuget` file, from [the dotnet interactive repo](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/tree/main/samples/my%20binder).    
    Binder can take a few moments to create and launch the container but it’s **live**, you
can change the code and re-run it. The container doesn’t have any access to your
machine (so files you need must be in the repo), but it is possible to install
modules, or to connect to an Azure Cloud-Shell or to run other commands which access
resources from the internet.

In case you weren’t aware that .NET interactive is cross platform, the screen
shot above shows the docker containers for binder run it via Python on Linux.
Binder disposes of the container then you leave or if you’re inactive for too
long.

I can see shared notebooks run using a service like binder as a way to do
“show your working” configuration or analysis of on-line services – and I’d pop
over to *Print-Preview* in Jupyter to generate a nice view of what has been done, like this:

![Print preview in Jupyter - on binder](/assets/3bcf7c7a500d56061f08aa5e1bc5c236.png)

As I said before, being JSON it’s possible to fiddle with the contents of the files, and I said I would come back to 
[Doug Finke's PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PowerShellNotebook) which I have been adding to.

First: Doug has a `Get-NotebookContent` function which returns objects with a `type` property set to “Code” or
“Markdown” and a `source` property. It only needs a couple of lines either to
print the Markdown or to run the source of a code cell. In others words **running the notebook in a normal PowerShell session**. Each block might
output a different type of object and PowerShell will try to format all output based on the properties of the first object so I use `Out-Default` to force a re-evaluation of the properties to display. Like this: 
{% highlight PowerShell %}
Get-NotebookContent .\datademo.ipynb | ForEach-Object {
    if ($_.type -eq "code") {Invoke-Expression $_.Source | Out-Default }  
    else                    {Write-Verbose -Verbose $_.source}
}
{% endhighlight %}

Doug also has a `ConvertFrom-NotebookToMarkdown` function and I tweaked things to let me run a command like this:     
`ConvertFrom-NotebookToMarkdown .\datademo.ipynb -Includeoutput`    
and get this

![Notebook converted to markdown](/assets/492b72509211cdac5f06eba977e2bab1.png)

Doug also created commands which allow a new notebook to be created like this:
{% highlight PowerShell %}
New-PSNotebook -NoteBookName .\TestNotebook -IncludeCodeResults {
    Add-NotebookMarkdown -markdown "# This is a H1 tag"
    Add-NotebookCode     -code     '"Hello World"'
}
{% endhighlight %} 

`-IncludeCodeResults` creates a *runspace* to process commands while `New-PSNotebook` is running, and triggers the running of each `source` block *in that runspace*
and puts its output in the cells' `output` fields. I made some tweaks here too – to have `-Verbose` show the output, and to allow the notebook to be either a
Windows PowerShell one for Azure Data Studio or to be a .NET interactive one. I catch a few of the magic commands – removing the redundant `#!pwsh` 
if the VSCode extension has said we have a C# *notebook* with PowerShell *cells*, and processing `#!About` and `#!Time` - and I added some aliases 
to make it a bit more like a domain specific language:

{% highlight PowerShell %}
notebook {  
    markdown $myMarkdownText  
    code     $MyPSScript  
} -DotNetInteractive test.ipynb
{% endhighlight %}
I’m not 100% that changing `code` from pointing to *Visual-Studio code* to
*Add-NotebookCode* is a good idea, but for now it gives me an interesting trick, 
which I’ll come to in a moment. I could combine the last example above with the
one to run code from the notebook and make something like this:

{% highlight PowerShell %}
notebook {
    switch (NotebookContent .\datademo.ipynb) {
        { $_.Type -eq 'markdown' } { markdown $_.Source }
        { $_.Type -eq 'code'     } { code     $_.Source -Verbose }
    }   
} -IncludeCodeResults -DotNetInteractive dd2.ipynb
{% endhighlight %}
The trick I mentioned is this: since I am running (via aliases) `markdown` if the
type field holds “markdown” and `code` if it holds “code” I could remove the
switch statement

{% highlight PowerShell %}
notebook {  
    NotebookContent .\datademo.ipynb | foreach {
        & $_.Type $_.Source -Verbose 
    }  
} -IncludeCodeResults -DNI new.ipynb
{% endhighlight %}
Either gives me a notebook like the one below.

![Read a notebook, run its code, write a new notebook](/assets/ed722a2faef14d8aa001e8c92d0061b1.png)

In the *terminal* window you can see some of the data which was displayed by
`-verbose` and which will be in the final cell of the notebook. At the top you can
see \#about and \#time have been processed and about shows the version of
PowerShell which ran the script.

But while I was writing I had one last idea. Doug uses a `runspace`. "Hmmm…" I thought "I can
connect to remote runspaces, so let’s add a `-runspace` option" and I got this:

![Remote running the notebook contents](/assets/9ffb748a0cdbc55cf351d2cdec2e9ba5.png)

Again this is something I can see a lot of use for, download the notebook and run its code (with nothing more than standard PowerShell) and return the filled in notebook. How about doing that in parallel for many remote machines?
