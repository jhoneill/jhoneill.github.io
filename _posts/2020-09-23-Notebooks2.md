In [part one](/misc/2020/09/21/Notebooks.html) I talked about **Jupyter** and *ipynb* files – they were called
“Interactive Python” before the Jupyter name was coined- and I said the **Python
extension for Visual Studio Code** can work with them, but it’s not great at
handling other languages like those found in *dotnet interactive notebooks* –
which I wanted for PowerShell support.

While I was looking at *code*, I saw that there is [a preview of notebook
support in the PowerShell
Extension](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/public-preview-of-notebook-mode-in-the-powershell-preview-extension-for-visual-studio-code/).
It requires [VS Code insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) and the
**preview edition** of the PowerShell extension. With those in place you need to
turn on the *PowerShell \> Notebooks: Show Toggle Button* option in VS Code’s
settings

The preview PowerShell extension leverages a **proposed Notebook API** for VS
Code (hence it is only in the *Insiders* version) and embeds
markdown as comments in **standard PS1 files** - the second option in *settings*
determines whether to insert it as block comments wrapped in \<\# … \#\> or line
comments. The extension turns a .PS1 file into notebook cells by reading into a
code cell until it hits a comment; the comment goes into a markdown cell; at the
end of the comment the next code cell begins, and the process repeats until the
end of the file.

A file like the one above has two simple markdown cells – one of them is plain
text, the other a heading2 style, alternating with two PowerShell commands. And
toggling into notebook view (with the button that’s circled in the screen shot)
produces the results below.

There are shortcomings, most of which are answered saying “It’s a preview”.
Execution and results are in the *PowerShell-integrated-Console* (no new
environment required) but the results don’t come back to the document. It’s
useful for scripts which alternate detailed explanation with their work or for
training cases where the reader will run the code for themselves. Where this
preview will go is hard to say, because almost in competition with it is **a VS
Code extension for .NET Interactive.**

The [.NET Interactive Notebooks
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode)
is also **in preview** and has the same need for the *insiders* version of VS
Code. It shows a lot of potential – to the point where I found myself thinking
of it as a finished product. The extension manages and updates its own instance of .NET
Interactive - separate from the one used for Jupyter (set-up is just the .NET SDK,
VS Code and the Extension) whenever .NET Interactive is updated the extension updates itself and its copy of .NET interactive. The “daily build” nature of it means thing do break
and get fixed – in a couple of weeks that’s only caused me a problem once, and
only for one day. It gave me a newer, but still not absolutely
up-to-the-minute version of PowerShell (7.0.2 instead of 7.0.3) than the
command line installation I’d used for Jupyter in [part one](/misc/2020/09/21/Notebooks.html)  
(I went back and updated that with the command    
`dotnet tool –global update "Microsoft.dotnet-interactive"` ).

The extension originally had its own file format for notebooks, but it can now
import and save .ipnyb files as well, formats may evolve further during the
preview. To avoid conflict with the Python extension the Open command is on the tool palette not the file menu

![ipynb files are opened from the VSCode command palette](/assets/9e4f6e8f75c1b67da046bd961a6727ef.png)

NET interactive supports “magic commands” to switch between its languages, which
allows a single notebook or even a single cell to contain PowerShell, C\#,
and/or F\#. To allow other ipynb tools to read such “polyglot” files, it adds a
magic command at the start of each code block, so Jupyter sees a C\# notebook
where each block says ‘run *this bit* in PowerShell’: but only the VS Code
extension understands that intelisense for the current *cell* might need to
different from the file setting (usually C\#).

Between the version I first installed for Jupyter and the one used by VS Code, a
mechanism was added to allow one language to ask for a variable set in another,
so, for example PowerShell can copy a variable from F\#, or pooled variables can
be set for all the languages.

With the PowerShell extension disabled and without an F\# extension installed 
VS Code could still parse and tab complete PowerShell and F\# - suggesting language support is
in the .NET Interactive extension. It *feels* like normal PowerShell editing,
although support for snippets is missing and PowerShell cells don’t follow all
the PowerShell extension options that I set. Everything I had tried in Jupyter
imported into VS Code, including plotly, as you can see in the screen-shot below.
 VS-Code’s embedded output didn’t always read with perfect fidelity in Jupyter, another place to say, “But it’s a preview!”

![The .NET Interactive extension in action with a Markdown cell, a PowerShell code cell showing rich editing and its result, showing plotly in action. ](/assets/4d40eb747463ddbae805ab8d9d2f1fe4.png)

I mentioned in part 1 that having a shell in a notebook is a good way to capture
and document command lines, and a shell in .NET interactive can run commands
from the `dotnet` cli as in the screen shot below, and I’m using it to put
together notes on those `git` commands that I only use occasionally.

The screen shot above shows Jupyter and the VS Code extension sometimes render the same output
differently – it has become double-spaced above, and the
next two screen shots show the difference in how a table is rendered. I also
found that that Jupyter renders markdown with a language block better than VS
Code does.

It looks like HTML Style sheets making the difference, so again, this may change. There are other 
differences – Jupyter has an easy way to expand or collapse
*output*. In VS Code it’s buried in a menu, but there are also options to hide
the *code*. If your markdown uses title styles, VS code can use it for
outlining and fold up code and markdown up to the next title. Jupyter doesn't have folding but does have “run
all cells” and “clear all output”, which VS Code doesn’t at the moment. Again, **it’s
a preview** and any of this might change.

The final notebook tool for this round up is [Azure data
studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sql/azure-data-studio). Database admins
like it, but it was a new product to me – and the first thing I noticed was the
striking similarity to Visual studio code.

![Azure data studio - looks similar to VS Code and the about box lists shared components](/assets/733dddce70a6d1d6a47cac75c8baf1e1.png)


<a href="/assets/23ab14170b8b9db440e935fde74bc9d1.png"><img style="float:right;display:inline;" border="1" alt="The VS Code About box listing very similar components to Azure Data studio" src="/assets/23ab14170b8b9db440e935fde74bc9d1.png" width="468" align="right" height="343" /></a> 
As well as a near identical layout, it references `VS Code` in the help
information and has a very similar set of components to the release VS Code.

I think of Data Studio as an app built from VS Code parts to know about
connecting to SQL Servers, submitting queries and doing useful things with the
results (extending what SQL Management Studio can do, and taking it cross-platform) -which grew into putting SQL, results and annotations into notebooks
and got more “notebooky” by connecting to Jupyter server (so it needs Python
installed). Whether or not that’s historically accurate, it is good way to
understand what it does.

Anaconda -which I used in part 1 - doesn’t install the R language Kernel out of
the box, but Azure Data Studio knows about it and will do the necessary Python /
Jupyter setup to make it work. It also has a **Windows PowerShell 5 Kernel** and
again sets that up for Jupyter on first use. One slightly odd behaviour is that
Data Studio doesn’t get the names of additional Kernels from the Jupyter server
until a notebook is opened, but then -unlike the Jupyter web interface – you can
change a notebook’s language to any that server has- it will turn ipynb files
saved by VS Code from presenting as C\# files with embedded PowerShell blocks to fully
PowerShell files. Unfortunately, some stuff – like plotly - just didn’t render.

If I were spending a lot of time working on SQL server, I'd find Azure data studio more compelling. 

What did I like in the different tools ?

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" border="1"><thead><tr><td>Product</td><td>Good points</td><td>Dislikes</td></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><b>Jupyter</b></td><td>Most mature product.<br/> All languages supported.<br/>Built-in translation and printing support.<br/>Some things just render <em>better</em>.</td><td>The Python / web server architecture.<br/>Editing is the least sophisticated<br/>(but still a reasonable experience).</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>VS-Code + <b5r/>.NET Interactive</b></td><td>Very good editing experience.<br/>Multiple languages per file.<br/>Simple set-up.<br/>Folding at markdown titles.</td><td>Other tools see .Ipynb files as C#,<br/>and don’t always read output parts correctly.</td></tr>

<tr><td><b>VS-Code + <br/>PowerShell</b></td><td>Best PowerShell editing experience.<br/>Native PS1 files can be used directly.</td><td>Doesn’t save results.<br/>Single language.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Azure<br/>Data Studio</b></td><td>Adds <em>Windows PowerShell</em> to Jupyter.<br/>(for modules which can’t run in PowerShell core)<br/>Works with all Jupyter Kernels.<br/>Database orientation.</td><td>Some output failures. (e.g. Plotly)<br/>Has Jupyter as a pre-requisite.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

Not keeping the results in the file killed the pure-PowerShell one for me –
although I **can** see cases where a .PS1 file with embedded markdown would be a
great solution. None of the others really lands a knockout punch. Someone
spending a lot of their day working with SQL Server will have a use for Azure
Data Studio even without Jupyter support, and that might give the final push to
adopt it, that doesn't apply to me. I do use VS Code and using the insiders
build, for now, doesn’t cause me too many problems; so that’s the solution I
lean towards. It’s not finished, and for sharing I would want to modify the
file’s metadata to ensure it is seen as PowerShell and re-generate the output in
Jupyter. Some things are better in one and other things are better in the other:
I’m happy working in Jupyter and slightly happier working in VS code.
